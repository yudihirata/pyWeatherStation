### Prerequisites
pyWeatherStation requires [Python libraries for Waveshare e-paper series](https://github.com/soonuse/epd-library-python)  to run. 
Before you download the source code, unsure your system meets the following requirements. 
-  OS: Raspbian
-  [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/2.2.1/) (Python Imaging Library)
-  [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
-  [Accuweather](https://developer.accuweather.com/) API Key(the Limited Trial is enough)

### Installation
 Pyllow
 Run the following:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get build-dep python-imaging
$ sudo apt-get install libjpeg8 libjpeg62-dev libfreetype6 libfreetype6-dev
$ sudo pip install Pillow
```
Matplotlib
It is easiest to use your system package manager to install the dependencies.
If you are on Debian/Ubuntu, you can get all the dependencies required to build 

```sh
$ sudo apt-get build-dep python-matplotlib
